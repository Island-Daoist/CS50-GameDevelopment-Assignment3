This project was completed as part of HarvardX's CS50's Introduction to Game Development course. Many of the fundamental processes and resources were
supplied by the course. The functionality listed below has been implemented on top of the initial code base:

1. Mouse Input for start menu and swapping of tiles in game

2. Shiny tiles now appear at random on board that destroy row on match

3. Validation of board in play to ensure that there is a valid move that can be made. If no valid move is present then board is shuffled.

4. Shuffling of board is accompanied by animation to hide sudden change of tiles.

5. Limitation of tile colours and varients based on level being played, to help ensure that valid matches can exist easily.

6. Only allow swaps of tiles if they result in a match being made


This was a great experience and although there are many other things that I can play around with I think this has been a good learning excerise.
